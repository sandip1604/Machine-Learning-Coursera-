##########    README LOGISTIC REGRESSION   #######################

IN THIS ASSIGNMENT LOGISTIC REGRESSION IS IMPLEMENTED. WHOSE BRIEF DETAILS ARE AS FOLLOW

Logistic regression model learned here predicts the chances of an applicant to be admitted in the university. 

1. Sigmoid function is used. 
2. update is made using gradient descent on signoid cost function. 
3. regularised cost fucntion is also implemeted for non linear decision boundry.
