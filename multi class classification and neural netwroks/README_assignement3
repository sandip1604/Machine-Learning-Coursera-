##########    README MULTICLASS LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND NEURAL NETWORKS - HANDWRITTEN DIGITS RECOGNITION #############

IN THIS ASSIGNMENT LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH MULTICLASS CLASSSIFICATION IS IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH NEURAL NETWORK. WHOSE BRIEF DETAILS ARE AS FOLLOW

 Multiclass Logistic regression model (one vs all) is trained to recognise the handwritten digits from 0 to 9. 

1. Sigmoid function is used. 
2. update is made using gradient descent on signoid cost function. 
3. regularised cost fucntion is also implemeted for non linear decision boundry.

** AFTER TAINING LOGOSITC REGRESSION, MODEL IS ABLE TO PREDICT THE PROBABILITY OF THE EXAMPLE TO BELONG TO EACH CLASS. ***

Training accuracy is 94%.
Test accuracy is 91%

Neural Network is also tested for the same purpose of recognition of hadnwritten digits in order to compare the perofrmnce with logistic regression. 

Training accuracy: 97.5%
Testing accuracy: 95%
