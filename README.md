This repository is created to handle the Project assignments of Machine Learning Course from Stanford on Coursera.

This repository contains files of the project assignment of the Coursera course on Machine learning by Stanford.

1. Assignment1: Simple Linear regression with single and multiple variables with gradient descent.
2. Assignment2: Logistic Regression with sigmoid learning function. - Predicting the probability of getting admitted to the University.
3. Assignment3: Multiclass classification using Logistic REgression and comparison with Neural network - Handwritten digits recognition.
4. Assignment4: Neural network trained for handwritten digit recognition using backpropagation
5. Assignemnt5: Regurlarised linear regression as a study of bias and variance. 
6. Assingment6: Designing a Spam classifier using SVM
7. Assignment7: using K-means and PCA dimensionality reduction and clustering. 
8. Assignment8: learned Anomaly detection (using Gaussian formulation) and Recommender system using collaborative filtering.
